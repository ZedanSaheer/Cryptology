                cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange
                wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized
                database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional
                coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like
                paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use
                decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.When a
                cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally
                considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through
                distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction
                database.

        <h3>
            why you should invest crypto-currency?
        </h3>
        <p class="why" id="info">Cryptocurrency is a good investment if you want to gain direct exposure to the demand
            for digital currency and the projects or businesses they facilitate.
            Whether crypto assets pay off for investors will ultimately be determined by whether they achieve wide-scale
            adoption.

            Bitcoin, for example, is seen by many as an investment akin to gold. Unlike fiat currencies, such as the
            U.S. dollar and Japanese yen, which can seemingly be printed at the will of politicians, bitcoin has a
            maximum supply of just under 21 million coins. Many investors thus view bitcoin as a scarce asset that could
            increase in value as fiat currencies depreciate. Others believe bitcoin could eventually gain extensive use
            as a digital form of cash, with some going so far as to say it has the potential to become the first truly
            global currency.

            Ethereum, meanwhile, wants to serve as a global computing platform. It serves as a launchpad for
            decentralized applications, or "dapps," which are open source and not controlled by a single organization.
            Ethereum allows the use of smart contracts, which have their terms written directly into code and can be
            executed automatically. These technologies could disrupt massive industries, such as real estate and
            banking, and potentially create entirely new markets.

            If Bitcoin and Ethereum can achieve these aims, then investors who buy their tokens today will likely be
            richly rewarded in the years ahead. But there are </p>

        <h4>top 10 crypto-currency!</h4>
        <p class="bitcoin">
            <span>Bitcoin</span>
            is the first, most well-known, and valuable cryptocurrency throughout the world. It is the first influential
            use of blockchain technology, which is a permanent and time-code ledger of transactions that is spread
            across all members of a network and is now being used in a variety of applications. The blockchain that
            underpins Bitcoin enables users to send and receive money without the need for a third-party intermediary
            like a bank or payment processor.

        </p>
        <p class="bitcoin"><span>Ethereum </span>
            is a great contender for the title of best cryptocurrency. It does not, however, compete with Bitcoin. It
            operates on a programmable blockchain, which means it can operate programs or applications on a
            decentralized basis, i.e. on millions of computers in one go. This opens up a plethora of potential
            applications, ranging from technology and finance to gaming and collectibles, making Ethereum an appealing
            investment.

        <p class="bitcoin"><span>Binance Coin</span>
            is one of the few cryptocurrencies that has surpassed its 2017 mark. There was a bull market during that
            year, and the prices of all cryptocurrencies increased along with it, hitting a peak before peaking and
            declining in value. Unlike the other cryptocurrencies, Binance Coin has maintained a slow but steady upward
            trajectory since 2017. Thus, Binance Coin has emerged to be one of the more reliable investment options with
            fewer risks due to its success.

        <p class="bitcoin"><span>Dogecoin</span>
             is a cryptocurrency, a kind of digital money that allows peer-to-peer transactions through a
            decentralized network, just like bitcoin. There are several ways you can obtain Dogecoin, like many other
            cryptocurrencies. You may dig it yourself, or approve it as a means of payment. Even so, the simplest
            approach is to buy it from a cryptocurrency exchange. You will usually need to purchase Bitcoin or another
            common coin first, and then exchange it for DOGE.

        <p class="bitcoin"><span>Cardano</span>
            As compared to larger networks like Bitcoin, the Cardano network takes less energy to complete transactions,
            making it cheaper and more efficient. It aims to be more flexible and stable, thanks to frequent updates
            that make it less vulnerable to hacking. And with a stronger network, though, it is still unable to compete
            with the big cryptocurrencies.

        <p class="bitcoin"><span>Tether</span>
            Since it is linked to the US dollar, Tether is the most reliable of all cryptocurrencies. The Federal
            Reserve Bank has one dollar for each unit of Tether. Tether is therefore ideal for investors who want to use
            their cryptocurrency to make transactions.

            , which was launched in 2012, is regarded as one of the quickest and most efficient
            decentralized payment innovations. Admittedly, XRP concludes transactions in four seconds, outpacing
            Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Ripple’s entire thesis is on payment methods.

        <p class="bitcoin"><span> Internet Computer</span>


            While Internet Computer was only officially released on May 10, 2021, it quickly climbed onto the Top 10
            list of the most valuable cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. According to CoinMarketCap, it’s the
            world’s first blockchain that runs at web speed with unbounded capacity and also the third major blockchain
            innovation, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        <p class="bitcoin"><span>Polkadot</span>
            is a distinctive proof-of-stake cryptocurrency aimed at bringing blockchain adequacy to the masses. Its
            interface connects permissioned and permissionless blockchains, along with oracles, enabling systems to
            interact in a single environment. Polkadot allows an internet where independent blockchains can exchange
            data and transactions in a transparent and secure manner through the Polkadot relay chain. Polkadot’s goal
            is to make it better to access and link decentralized applications, services, and organizations.
